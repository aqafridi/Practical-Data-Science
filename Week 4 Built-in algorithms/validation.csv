__label__0 "but-the problem is i can not get the color to stay below the shoulders . the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that did n't lay right . if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me . i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves but i ca n't get the desired look to work out so this is going back ."
__label__-1 "cute top but started disintegrating after two washes . the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart . i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and did n't use the dryer . disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it ."
__label__-1 "fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away . however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived . while the cut is cute the fabric is just all wrong . i was expecting a nice heavy knit-like material but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress . sadly it is going back ."
__label__-1 "i usually love a cowl neck sweater but not this one . you ca n't wear it off the shoulders and it 's weirdly sheer too . the only pro is that it does n't include wool or fur ."
__label__0 "i thought i was getting this nice light weight white sweater but not the case . it is a pretty heavy nice thick cotton and beautiful made . it does run large . i got the small and love the oversize feel even on my 5 ' 9 frame . but - it is not white it is beige and it is not light weight . i have enough beige sweaters in this look so this one is going back even though it was a great buy on sale ."

__label__0 "i love these pants but they run super big and still stretch after wearing . i am usually a 2/ 26 and had to get a 0. also the pocket flaps stick up on the corners and ironing doesnt help . still comfortable but i would have never paid full price for these if i had known ."

__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress -- a throw-on-and-go outfit that was casual enough with sneakers for errands but stylish enough with dressy sandals for a brunch date -- but did n't for a couple of reasons . first it is way too short for me especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay to wear as a dress . it was more tunic length- but i would n't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic . also the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th"

__label__0 "these jeans fit well and the stretch makes them comfortable . i ca n't recommemd them though because they 're see through . wish white jeans were better lined so that this is n't usually a problem !"
__label__-1 "this dress was not what i had hoped ! from the online pictures i had high hopes but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap . the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress . needless to say it 's going back !"
__label__-1 "i know this is supposed to look oversized and i own a few oversized ponchos but this takes oversized to a whole new level . i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference . if you are looking for that it seemed like good qualify ."
__label__-1 "i love the design and the fabric but the fit is just off on this dress . the area around the bust is just not fitted well . the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat . that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress but the waist also sat too high on me ( maybe i 'm long waisted who knows ? ) so between the super high waist and the flannel-type fabric it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me . i wish it were n't so . i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou"
__label__1 "i 'm very glad i snatched this up when i did . it is super soft and the perfect length . i love the slight peplum as it makes for a very flattering fit . i can tell this shirt will be a staple year round as it works great with shorts or jeans . for me i think the large was a tiny bit big in the waist but it might shrink in the wash. the armholes were nice too and did n't gap ."
__label__-1 "these were perfect in the legs nice and stretchy but problematic in the waist . i 'm generally a 31/size 12 but i had to squeeze to get them to close . they 've already gone back . if you have a tinier waist they 'd probably be fine ."
__label__0 "very nice top like the linen fabric . i ordered my regular size m and its huge . makes me look larger than i am and i will be returning it . i would like a size s i think just not a flattering oversize fit for me"

__label__1 "this dress is amazing ! i love the collaboration with rifle paper . it has a nice boho swing look . i sized down from my typical small and took an xs . both fit well but i wanted the shoulders to be more fitted ."
__label__1 "i loved this top and i normally order petites when i 'm able to but this was n't offered in a petite size so i took a chance and ordered it in regular . just got it in the mail and when i pulled it out i thought wow it is a petite ! but its not just runs small . i got the xs size and it was tight under the arms and the peplum bottom came up a bit high and felt slightly maternity-ish the way the bottom part flared out . i actually thought it was a bit too short too even on me ( 5 ' 2 about 118 lbs"
__label__0 "the way the back came down so much made the top look weird . i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much . also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture . so to me it was just a over priced odd top ."
__label__1 "i have a few pair of charlie 's and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit . i own this pair in both the orange and gray bought both in my normal 4. they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on do n't size up . definitely recommend these pants ."
__label__1 "lovely dress in bright teal color . the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned . unfortunately i sized up ( 6 ) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size ( 4 ) . the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i 'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues . this is really a great buy with the current sale . tempted to pick up the red version too ."
__label__1 "this cardigan is utterly gorgeous . way prettier on than i feared . my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms and so i finally looked closely at the tag . the tag says the * back * section ( which looks exactly like the weave on the arms ) has a measly 5 % wool snuck into the fabric content . why retailer ? why wool ? i am so sensitive to it ! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it . now i have a problem"

__label__-1 "it 's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline but unfortunately it 's scratchy will not last . i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears . it 's a nice shade of offwhite at least . for me it 's a no that will get sent back straight away ."
__label__1 "the color is deep coral and perfect for fall to top jeans or leggings . i love the big slouchy look so the drapey quality is a plus ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this . it is so cute and the xxsp my usual size fit perfectly . however there was a fatal flaw in the construction . the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided . instead of a scoop like shown on the model it was much longer on one side than the other . i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong . this is going back . i ordered another one ( now it 's on backorder ) hopefully"
__label__1 "this top is amazing . so soft and the off the shoulder part stays where it belongs . i 'm usually a large but got this in a med . fits perfectly ."
__label__1 "so this dress is absolutely gorgeous ! my problem is i am 5'10 and it is very short wasted . between the shoulders and waist and even the arm holes it just plain does n't work . i think if you are taller this dress just wo n't work . i have purchased other items from this name brand and have had the same problem ."

__label__-1 "this looked beautiful online but the skirt is n't 100 % silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels with most of them containing some level of polyester . parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap . overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online . a definite return . i would n't even recommend this at first or second cut ."
__label__1 "i own several of retailer 's kimonos & this has to be the prettiest . the colors are rich & more beautiful in person . i ca n't wait to pair this with jeans & shorts this summer !"
__label__-1 "beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments . true to size . it 's not thick but it 's very warm ."
__label__1 "one of the more beautiful pieces retailer hags carried in a long time . i instantly fell in love the second i took it out of the box . the only problem is that it runs short in the torso . i ordered the xs and it fit perfectly everywhere except it gave me a wedgie . for reference i am 5 ' 6 120 lbs and a 34b . i returned the jumpsuit and ordered it in a small . hopefully it 's long enough ! ! ! everything about it is true to size except torso length . i have an average torso so someone with a large torso m"
__label__0 "love the color cut and weight ( its like a fleece-weight coat but longer and more appropriate for an office . ) within two wears one of the buttons popped off . within three wears one of the back shoulder seams had split . this coat is lovely but shoddily made . worth it with a discount and if you know how to hand-sew because minor repairs will be in your future . it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality ."
__label__1 "these pants are a life saver . i love to travel with them and have washed them in a hotel sink rolled in a towel and hung dry with good results . picro does not usually fit me well these pants are the exception . i 'm 5 ' 6 and if i uncuff them they can be worn as regular length . great for a baseball game ! i will panic if retailer ever changes or discontinues them ! ! ! !"
__label__1 "anytime i see this brand at retailer in a button down i have to buy it . fit is always so flattering comfy and the prints are always great !"
__label__-1 "did n't like the dress . look pregnant in it . this dress is going back ."
__label__-1 "as the previous reviewer mentioned the pockets ruin this dress . pockets usually such a good idea ! but here they 're misplaced ( right on the hips ) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress ... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets . this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss ."
__label__1 "love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days . i love the squishy soft feel of the material . it works well with sweaters . love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet . i love how simple and practical this coat is . the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head ."
__label__-1 "so this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer . this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute . it looked a million times cuter in the photos ."
__label__1 "i felt a review would be helpful for anyone between sizes . i am long lean and broad shouldered . i normally wear a m but ordered a l. it still fits snug so i 've exchanged for an xl in order to get the drape as pictured on the model . material and color of the red motif is darling ; light as a feather & will take me spring through summer ."
__label__1 "normally i am a size 10 or 12 but i sized down to a small . still very swingy and beautiful . i bought the pink and the taupe as well . the colors are beautiful and have great texture to hide stains !"
__label__-1 "i would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure . these pants seem to be cut straight up and down . the fabric is not soft the color is slightly more muted in person and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model ."
__label__1 "this sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning ! i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on . i do n't usually pay this much for a cardigan but the quality and feel are better than usual ."
__label__-1 "i should have paid closer attention to the other reviews . i could barely get this blouse over my head ! after getting it on the armholes too are very small . the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie . i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck . i tried the small but think a medium would n't have been much better . it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves . i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair . if you have a tiny head and pencil a"
__label__-1 "i would n't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75 % less . they are so cheaply constructed . one wash and they 're all but guaranteed to shrink . the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer . they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them ."
__label__0 "this top is very pretty but it does n't make up for the problems with it . retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late . the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased do n't seem to hold up to normal use and washing . i normally wear a medium in tops . the medium in this top was huge . i needed an extra small which means a lot of people are sized out of this top . i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk ! it shrunk so much that i can"
__label__0 "this top is gorgeous in person but when i tried it on i fell out of love . it did n't happen immediately but the more i wore it around the fitting room area the less i appreciated its beauty . i tried it on in an xs - i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops - 5 ' 8 140 lbs for reference . this top is just huge in the body ! the fit is very boxy and just not flattering . yes it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggo 's ! this was just a miss for me ."
__label__0 "loved the grey color and the design but the shirt ran huge . i ordered a 2 and it fit me like an extra large . i am 5 ' 2 about 110 pounds and not flat chested ."
__label__-1 "here 's an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term 'petite ' on it . too much fabric was bulky and ran too small . the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust . returned .."
__label__0 "the green color was beautiful but the top was too low cut and looked more maternity than boho ."
__label__1 "the color of this dress is sublime . so is the fit . ruching in all the right places . made me feel glamorous . it 's a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat vest or cropped jacket . the material feels so nice against the skin too . it 's a must have ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but it just did n't fit in anyway . i ordered an xs petite and it was very large . the lacing in the back is completely useless and that 's what i liked about the dress . i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top ( because of chest ) and then lace more tightly near the waist . it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering . beautiful fabric great color combo bad fit ."
__label__-1 "i had high hopes for this tunic for an upcoming ny trip - to look stylish and beat the heat . it is huge . the tunic swallowed my whole . it came down nearly to my knees ( i 'm 5 ' 6 ) and it was gigantic - shapeless and did not look stylish at all . on the model it looks like it hits mid-thigh . i am a size 10 - and the l was like a giant trash bag on me . if i had time i would try the medium ..."
__label__1 "i saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream . i have worn it every chance i get . it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans . the length is perfect the design is flattering and the material is soft and comfortable . the sleeves are snug- but i like this feature especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse . this will be a go to item . thanks retailer- another gem !"
__label__0 "i agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very 80 's ! ! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors but in person it 's a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80 's colors ! ! if you 're going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you 'll be disappointed ... : ( it looked to be true to size but to be honest i hated it so much i did n't even try it on ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this coat so bad . the material is lovely and it 's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off . if you have any hips forget it ( my hips are 38 ) - you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy . the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders .... like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted it was weird . but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it was n't a size thing . i bought a size medium at 5 ' 5 and 140 pounds ."
__label__0 "pretty tee but not worth the price . lace is beautiful but fit is blah ."
__label__1 "got these in the red brick color and unfortunately had to send them back . these are really cute and i loved the color and pattern but they ran very small and the cut between the legs and hips was odd . this may not have been a problem had i gone up at least one size . best to try them on if possible ."
__label__1 "i really like the appearance of this item and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings . it does run a little large . i am a true to size small and this hangs on me a little but i love the design of the back . it is so soft and comfortable !"

__label__1 "the romper is well made and just plain cute . i bought it the second i saw it and do n't regret my impulse buy one bit . 135 5 ' 5 and the small fit perfectly ."
__label__0 "i was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail . the fabric is so comfortable but the print was overwhelming . it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom . i had to return it ."
__label__-1 "large and the material is too bulky . i returned it ."
__label__-1 "this piece did n't make sense to me . maybe it 's bc i 'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer . i did n't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear . it went back ."
__label__-1 "the pattern is very adorable . unfortunately the design is flawed . sizing is great at the waist and hip and the length is spot on but the top is wide . it 's strange because i do n't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either . will return . i 'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it ."
__label__0 "i really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste . it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger . really cute style just not sure it 's worth the price . great colors though ."
__label__0 "for reference : 5 ' 3 130 # athletic/muscular body type ( broad shoulders slim hips ) i ordered the small and i was absolutely swimming in it . perhaps the petite would have been better but there was just too much fabric everywhere . the sleeves were ridiculous on me and even cinching the waist with a belt just would n't have slimmed the silhouette for me . i have muscular shoulders and 34d chest so the top fit as it should just everything became way too much elsewhere . the fabric was soft and sw"

__label__0 "i ordered this dress in small my usual size ( for reference : 5 ' 7 125 lb ) . it is too wide . it looks more fitted in the pictures and hangs loose on me . the belt does not help much ; it still looks like a sack and i feel like a girl wearing her mom 's dress . also i found that the material crumples easily ."
__label__0 "i was confused by this dress . the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy . it 's also not lined and the material is not exactly soft . i put it back . cute but missed the mark ."

__label__1 "gorgeous dress . perfect for something special . paired with black heels . runs a touch large . i normally wear a small ( 5 ' 6 and 140 pounds ) but i 'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it 's very roomy . the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it 's just so pretty i do n't care ! def a keeper ."

__label__-1 "i have several maeve dresses that fit really well . this was not the case with this dress . fabric and color are great ! fit was off especially in top . worst part was zipper that would n't move smoothly . took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped . such a bummer !"
__label__1 "the colors style and fit were great . this dress you could wear on many different occasions . all around great piece to own !"
__label__-1 "this shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures . it is short and very wide . i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid ."
__label__-1 "but it runs super small . i wear a medium for everything but could n't come close to buttoning this . the buttons were about 4 inches apart ( horizontally ) probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit . the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires truth in sizing"
__label__1 "love this jacket ! got my usual size medium and is perfect ! beautiful quality"
__label__0 "this is a pretty adorable jumper . the size 8 would fit someone really well who 's about a typical size 6 and maybe 5 ' 6 . i 'm 5 ' 9 and it was too short . it 's fun and definitely different . i 'd otherwise wear it ."

__label__-1 "i ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile . when it arrived the pleat in front ( shown in the center ) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked . not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that 's the true design but it will have to go back . too bad because i had high hopes !"
__label__-1 "i ordered a size small . i am 5 ' 7 size 6 and the dress was a mini on me ! way shorter than on the taller model . the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high so the dress was both too small and too big ! very odd fit . the material is soft thick stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked . this one is going back ."
__label__0 "i usually wear an 8 which was n't available and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it 's a set-in waist band . the fabric is pretty the skirt is fully lined the length is not too short and the only thing i do n't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version but on the black it stands out . it 's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays ."
__label__1 "i ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you 're well endowed . it 's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs . have n't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized ( but cozy ) and it 's really long . it almost touches the top of my knees in back . sooooo pretty though ."
__label__-1 "like some other reviewers i too have to comment on the dress 's fit . the dress does n't fit right around the bust or the waist . as a seamstress myself i know that the problem is that it does n't have any darts in the bust and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size . this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right . while a belt helps i do n't think it helps enough to justify the price . it 's too bad -- i think the concept of it is cool and i was rea"

__label__0 "i really liked the top once i saw it but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath . the fabric is a little stiff . it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist . the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine but it is a nice top ."
__label__1 "this t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything . my only concern is the fabric is super light . not enough to be see through but just enough to make me question the quality . i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though . the drape is nice and not super revealing ; discreet enough for work . i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile ."
__label__1 "i love this top ! it is modest enough for work but fun enough for weekends . soft comfortable and lovely pink color . i want it in every color !

__label__0 "i like this shirt as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts . however after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans . so : good if you do n't like long t-shirts bad if you are tall like me ( 5 ' 8 ) and do n't want to wear a crop top ."
__label__-1 "this dress was really odd . i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that 's about it . the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large . i was just very underwhelmed with this dress . also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution . overall its okay just hated it on me ."

__label__1 "really cute top comfy with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit or worn just casual . not clingy at all ... in fact maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color ! i typically wear a large but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down ."

__label__0 "i love cashmere love the length cowl-neck and colors however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person which i liked . i 'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste . i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater ... i might justify this one at a sale price ."
__label__-1 "the tank looks nothing like the one pictured mainly because it 's tissue-paper thin . also i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit . i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large . the armholes hit halfway to my waist . obviously i did n't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned ."

__label__0 "i 'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations . it 's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt . unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short ( it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach ) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you ( accentuating your stomach and ma"

__label__0 "this top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price . it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it . also the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt . still the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans ."

__label__0 "this top is very nice . i ordered it in black it looked very good . the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look . the fabric however feels like heavy cotton . it did n't feel very soft and comfortable it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton . while i think this will retain it 's shape and not stretch like softer cotton i am sending it back . it felt a bit heavy to wear ."
__label__1 "i was not sure whether i would like an xs or a s. rompers can be tricky . i am 5 ' 6 123lbs . i went ahead and ordered the xs and it is perfect . it is just long enough in the body for me . the shorts length is perfect not too short or too long . i ca n't wait to wear this !"
__label__-1 "i ordered this tee despite the price . the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor . nice concept for a tee but failed in quality and value . it was returned ."
__label__-1 "ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping . not well designed . i do n't recommend this tee at all ."
__label__0 "i totally agree with the first review . i thought this was soooo cute on the model but it 's loose fitting and has no shape to it ."
__label__0 "so this is just the most lovely romper . beautifully made flowey . very comfortable until you have to take it off . this is the review i posted on facebook . so no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror or maybe has not shared with me that moment when you can not get out of because it has turned into a straight jacket that otherwise cute romper . and again maybe a man invented it !"
__label__-1 "this top did nothing for me . it billowed in the front and was not flattering . for reference i am 54 115 pounds and small chested . i ordered the smallest size the top came in ( can not recall if it was an xs or 0 ) . i promptly returned it ."
__label__0 "tried on this maxi dress recently hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin . so sad : ( . unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much . a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress in the photos and could n't wait to try it on in person . the print varies from dress to dress and mine had noticeably much more cream color in it . i did n't mind too much but it did n't look like the dress the model is wearing . i bought the xxs petite which fit true to size . the v neck is a bit low for petite sizing but the length was perfect on my 5 ' 2 frame which was a plus . i agree with the other reviewers the fabric is cheap and feels cheap . not something i would expect from"
__label__-1 "the fit of this top is nothing like in the photo . the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette . in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large . the embroidery details and soft material are great but the fit is off entirely . this item is going back ."
__label__-1 "the fabric of this top is lovely . the fit not so . it does not fit as shown on the model . the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a swing top . i am 5 ' 9 slim build . i ordered my usual size medium . shoulders and back fit perfectly . too much material around the middle . had it had a straight cut to it as shown i 'd keep it . because it does n't it 's going back ."

__label__1 "i was on the fence about this top because i do n't typically do longer tunic styles . however it really is quite lovely . i paired it with long jeans wedge sandals and a delicate necklace - so pretty ! it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length ."
__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted this is a pretty top . i really love the design . alas however it is too big for my frame . for reference i am barely 5 ' 1 and about 105 lbs . i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me . it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place . the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits . i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp . i am going to have to part with it sadly ."

__label__1 "absolutely beautiful and well made . this pair of jeans is perfect no flaws whatsoever . i usually wear size 27 but bought the 26 as it fits better . 27 is very slightly loose but i think it supposed to be like that for a boyfriend jeans . i prefer it nice and fitted so 26 works better . i 'm lucky to find them still available in the store while it 's not online . i did n't hesitate to buy at full price which i rarely did . i 'm so in love with my new purchase . very happy !"

__label__-1 "tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece but the quality is below average for an retailer dress . it 's just a shapeless thin beach cover-up that i could 've picked up anywhere . the yellow color is so cute though . if you 're looking for a light breezy go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel this might be good for you but it 's too thin for just about anything else ."
__label__1 "it 's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i ca n't wait for cooler weather . i tried it on with skinny jeans and it 's darling . love how it 's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum . perfect for leggings . nice slim but not tight fit ."
__label__0 "this dress is not what i expected . the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it . the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry . when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms . i would n't of paid full price but for the amount i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter ."

__label__1 "this dress is extremely body conscious . so if you want to make an impression wear this dress . the fabric is thick and best worn on a cooler night . the pattern is gorgeously done pieced together like a garment three times the cost . the cut of the armholes might not be flattering on those with broad shoulders or chubby upper arms ( like myself ) . for me this dress is tts but way too long so i will have to hem ."

__label__0 "i love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears -- very detailed . it is both subtle ( not cheap looking ) and special . as an earlier reviewer noted the top is not see-through a plus . the drawbacks though mean that i will be returning this top . 1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well . i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose even in that size and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives"

__label__1 "i was very hesitant to purchase this with such a high price tag but i just received it in the mail and it is absolutely beautiful . feels and looks high quality and i ca n't wait to pair it with the top the model is wearing in the photos . definitely worth it !"

__label__0 "definitely pj quality . i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent . and it 's very thin so it works as a swim cover but definitely not a dress for anything else ."
__label__-1 "i bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide . i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online . the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model . i am 5 ' 1 tall and weigh 110 lbs . i believe the petite would have been a much better fit . i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available ."
__label__1 "i bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it 's beautiful ! it 's delicate and feminine without being too girly or frilly . very simplistic . and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own ! my only con is that i 'm a little tall and it does n't hit me completely on the waist but it 's still very flattering ."
__label__-1 "this tunic only barely resembles the photo in person . first the color is much less saturated and more orangey than it appears in the photos second it 's huge . i 'm 5 ' 4 and typically wear 2 or 4p in retailerpolgies ' shirts/dresses . i ordered the sp and the dress was at least 1.5 times wider than it needed to be . it hung off me completely boxy and shapeless ; and the style does n't really lend itself to use with a belt ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress however it has no shape to it . it is also somewhat see through so something needs to be worn under it . i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned . i 'm extremely disappointed . i do not recommend ."
__label__1 "these are great wear- anywhere shorts . they are not too long and not too short . they are very soft and comfy . i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps . i will still keep the 6 's for wearing around the house ."
__label__0 "i really like how this looks on the model but in real life this top is much tighter . i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops . i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes . i returned it a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her . so best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips ."

__label__-1 "this is a nice shirt but i ca n't keep it . i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am ( usually wear 00 petite in all pants ) and i think this size was perfect ( fit across the back perfectly ) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach . at the same time the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back . i 'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute"

__label__-1 "i have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun . i really wanted to like it but i could not . there were spots missing sequence some fell off as i tried the dress on and i did try it on twice . each time there were some on the floor . they are sewed on so poorly for the price of this dress . i fear it would be a dress for one season and i 'd have to throw it out . not for that price . so back it goes ."
__label__-1 "i thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high . in fact two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid . however as we were looking at the items we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality as the previous reviewer noted . therefore none of us purchased the pants . the staff at the store were very helpful"
__label__0 "ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off . i love the drape in the front but it did not hit in the right place . the fabric was soft but not as high end looking as i was expecting . i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look but sadly this is going back ."

__label__0 "the top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it 's not at all in person . made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body . the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt . the sleeves have a similar cut as well . i too am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you . it 's s"

__label__1 "this dress is just absolutely adorable ! you can dress it up and wear it to a wedding or you can dress it down and slip on a pair of sandals and use it as a casual summer dress ! this dress does run a tad bit large - i 'm usually a size 4 but the size 4 was slightly too big for me . best purchase yet !"
__label__1 "i love wearing this pullover with leggings and boots . it 's soft comfortable and loose fitting ."
__label__1 "this is adorable and unique . i 've tried shawls and ponchos before they usually swallow me up this sweater has that type of feel but is n't so much fabric . goes with everything ."
__label__-1 "when i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous . i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be . they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child 's dress arms on my dress ."

__label__1 "soft and flowy . fit is great . quality is great . i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well . i have n't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first . highly recommend . i paired this with 4 short black suede boots and black tights . many compliments ( even from my husband and he does n't usually pay much attention ) ."
__label__1 "love the design ( i got the blue and green one ) . it was more see-through than i thought but the pattern covers it so it does n't matter what color bra you wear ."
__label__1 "loved it . i have receive so many compliments when i wear this . it fit great ."
__label__1 "i absolutely love this dress ! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments . i have also worn it over leggings and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals . even though the material is somewhat thin i did not have to wear a cami with it . the fabric pattern is really cute !"
__label__0 "this sweater is incredibly soft and pretty but there is just no way to get it to lay the way the model does in the picture . i found myself constantly tugging at the top to get it to stay off the shoulder - otherwise it just bunched up top and make a weird funnel neck . i really wanted it to work but it was just so impractical ."
__label__-1 "this is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear . this brand makes some of the softest cutest tees but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry . not worth the cost ."
__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted the fit of this tee is very boxy . it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans but otherwise is unflattering . also the color is described as black but mine looks like a navy blue in person . i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult but if able to i would have returned it ."
__label__1 "i was attracted to this sweater because of it 's unique style . i really love it . it looks just like the picture . it is of good quality as is the leather belt . it is the perfect fall sweater and i love that it 's different . i highly recommend this sweater ."
__label__-1 "the shirt is very big . it would be cute as a maternity shirt ."
__label__0 "in my opinion for this amount of money the dress needs to be something really different . and this one is n't . it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality ( summery material dark color flirty and fun ... but overly conservative up top . ) initially the top portion is extremely sheer . you 're saved ( a bit ) by the extra fabric at the front but it still seemed odd that the top is n't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter . there 's too much going on up top . th"

__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this dress but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back . will be returning ."
__label__0 "i love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious"
__label__1 "this top is an amazing go to piece and yes i have all the colors i could grab my hands onto . i will say that under the arms small little balls of fabric begin to appear with wear . therefore it will need a quick once over with your sweater shaver from time to time . good staple for a great price ."
__label__1 "i just bought this dress today and it is absolutely stunning . it looks so much better in person than on the model . i think it runs true to size however it does have relaxed fit . overall the dress has nice quality fabric and nice flow without adding bulk . great buy !"
__label__-1 "i wanted to like this dress but it just did not work for a bustier frame . the fabric is quite loose does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy so if you are well-endowed your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs . as a result the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips ( as on the model ) and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward . on smaller curves this would likely be very flattering but"
__label__0 "i saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online . so sad to see how this dress fits : just right up top just right along the hem and then it 's a hot potato-sack-frump mess in the middle . it 's a shame because the fabric is beautiful ."

__label__-1 "i 'm on the shorter ( 5 '' 3 ) side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer . this is a lovely suit but it did n't work at all for me . it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted . the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all . it was very tight and pinched . sadly i returned it ."
__label__0 "i was so excited to get this ! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue . it reminded me of the ocean . however the fit was off . the waist was too high the length too short and the straps to long . i was very disappointed . i considered taking it to the tailor before returning . ultimately i decided to return ."
__label__1 "cute to wear with leggings . i like that it 's easy to just throw on . it 's fitted at the top and easy to chase kids around but does n't look too momish or sloppy ."

__label__1 "i knew i had to have this as soon as i saw it pop up in the tops section . it 's effortless . love the quirky design and the overall fit . it 's a tad on the large side but i 'm all about the flow these days . oh and the poms at the bottom about sent me over the edge . fantastic piece ."
__label__0 "i was so excited to get this top .. but it 's boxy and a little itchy from the design . i just did n't think it was worth the hefty price . i 'm normally a small in retailer clothing"
__label__1 "i ordered the moss green color . i love it ! the color is really cool the length is longer and the fabric is soft . great summer option !"
__label__0 "so this is a great tee problem is the white you can see through . i an not looking for a layering tee so not what i was looking for ."
__label__1 "i love love love this top ! the color is beautiful a pinkish-orange about exactly how it looks online . it is soft and light weight for summers . it does run a little big i debated between a 0 and a 2 and ended up with a 2 i 'm almost 5 ' 7 and 130lbs for reference . it wings out on the sides at first once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely so do n't let that turn you off from it when trying it on ! part of the design is cut out through out as a warning"
__label__1 "love the look of these- casual or dressy depending on what you pair with them . they are so comfortable ! edgy but relaxed - joggers with a leather look- what more could you ask for ?"
__label__0 "this dress it is heartbreakingly gorgeous stunning . the entire idea and design is so gorgeous ! the style with the sleeves embroidery and slight shimmer at the top two layers underneath the dress is extremely gorgeous . i am so so so sad i could not keep it . i do n't get why the sizes are so off here . i have come across so many clothes with gorgeous embroidery but too loose or too tight . i did n't want to send this dress back but it did not look good . it was just too loose . sad ! !"

__label__-1 "and the bottom looks like a tutu . first i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves . there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly . second the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt . finally the color on the green one is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint . back it goes ."
__label__-1 "this dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer 's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture which is how it looks from the photo . obviously it would have been more expensive but in any case this was just a really expensive polyester dress which it says in the product description but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product it 'll be retailer . but now i"

__label__-1 "i got this in a l and probably i am a m. however the waist pretty much fit but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way . i do n't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress . this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust but a small waist ."
__label__0 "the dress is too big . i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart ( for reference : 5 ' 7 125 lb ) . it is too wide not as fitted as in the picture . the cut is too deep ( might work better for a bustier lady but looks pathetic on me ) . the pattern is too bright much brighter that in the picture ( i got red pattern ) . it 's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately it 's just ... the colors are much more vibrant in real life . the material is heavier than i expected ."
__label__-1 "the design is very flattering and holiday appropriate . but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used . although figure flattering the zipper is so cheap that -- it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress . and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they 're asking for it . maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail"

__label__0 "this top was so pretty online ! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person though the back was gorgeous with a button gather at center . the color appeared yellow online but was a bit more green in person . also the armholes were very low so it would need a camisole or no bra ."
__label__0 "this dress is stunning no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif thick material nicely cut with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly . however the fact that this dress has zero stretch ( which is fine if that 's what you 're looking for ) coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured make this dress exhausting to put on . i 'm normally a 14/16 at retailer and i ordered the 16 just to be safe and the waist is exactly the size of my waist"
__label__1 "i was looking for a top to go with leggings that did n't look like a sack and this is perfect . the v-neck and unusual cut on the bottom makes it more interesting than a typical tunic and the fabric is so snuggly . love it ."
__label__1 "i agree with everything the other reviewer stated . this top is very billowy and runs large it would be nice if i did n't have a chest ! the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber . the pink is slightly more pink in person but it 's not that far off . had to return ."

__label__-1 "unfortunately this sweater let me down ! i love retailer especially their sweaters but this one fell flat . it was tight on the arms and did n't hang well on my body . it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame . i kept it because i wanted to force it to work alas i just donated it . hopefully it fits someone else better than me .."
__label__0 "close but no cigar ... the design and color were cute . the sweater itself was too warm for me and itchy . the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom it almost had strange fold in the front . look closely at some of the photos and you 'll see what i mean . sadly it went back ."
__label__1 "this is the most intricate delicate beautiful dress i have seen in a long time ! the pale blue coppery brown and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin dark hair and light eyes . unfortunately my normal size was far too snug especially on my hips and this is now sold out . the fabric has no give so i would say with any curves size up if you can find this beauty . i 'm heartbroken to be returning it !"
__label__-1 "read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item ! however the item came with unrepairable holes not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap . did n't even try it on . so sad but i still love retailer ! ! !"

__label__0 "for my body type this top looked ridiculous ! i am small-busted and thinnish on top . this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me . very unflattering . hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide . i think for a gal with more substantial upper body ( i.e . boobs ) this would work better ."

__label__0 "i fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online ; but i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered . on the positive side the macrame is stunning . once again there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant . most importantly the color is not peach ! it 's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange . it was a disgusting color ."

__label__-1 "the skiers cats and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns . unfortunately the fit was awful . i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite . the skier fabric is also see-through . the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in but it is not very long . 100 % rayon fabric is a bummer too . the shirt was snug at the bicep but not as bad as i expected from the reviews . i sized up from an 8 to 10 ."

__label__-1 "i grabbed my typical size ( 8 ) and found it fit snug in the bust . the fabric has plenty of stretch so the snugness was fine especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front . it 's lowcut but i did n't feel particularly exposed . i ended up not buying it because i do n't think it fit my body right . the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole"

__label__1 "i love this dress . i 've received compliments from everyone . it 's long enough to feel appropriate for work or teaching in sunday school - and it 's beautiful !"
__label__1 "this is a great tunic for those of us who like to wear leggings as pants once in a while it covers all the important parts without being too baggy . i found the fabric to be light and comfortable but heavy enough that a light colored bra ca n't be seen underneath with it great if you do n't feel like wearing multiple layers ."
__label__1 "i was n't expecting much out of this when i was in the store but liked the colors and thought i 'd try it out . grabbed a s and xs ( i 'm usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes ) - the s fit perfectly ( tts ) and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit . it does have a detachable slip/liner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue . in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on me ... falling low"

__label__1 "it 's a pretty dress my only concern is the sleeve length . it 's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy . i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better ! . or if you are a savvy sewer you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted . overall quality and feel is very good . i usually fit into a 6 but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you do n't order the correct size ."
__label__-1 "this top looked so cute in the picture but unfortunately does n't live up to it ! the one i received actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt . it makes it much darker and boring . the shirt itself is on the short side and would 've looked better if it hit lower on the hips there 's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that ."
__label__1 "i love this dress ! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish but are also very comfortable ... this dress fit the bill . the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online and the fabric is so soft it almost feel like wearing pajamas . the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely and so it 's flattering . overall a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe ."

__label__0 "this is a gorgeous top ; however it is very sheer and see through . maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker ?"

__label__-1 "i love sundry and their fun designs -- i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey . it is just not what i expected from the picture . i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body ."

__label__0 "if you 're tall this dress sits up too high-waisted and this makes your waist look big . it 's also kind of thin material on top and stretchy so even though i 'm small chested it made my shoulders and chest look large but not on a good way . in other words this dress made me look fat . the length is not bad for taller gals . all in all not worth it ."

__label__0 "this top runs small across the top . i was amazed at the material -- polyester i am sure -- because the price was so high . it has a sheer layer underneath which i think would make it hot in the summer . i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online ."

__label__0 "this top was a disappointment for me . it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it 's shape . it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south .... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape ."

__label__1 "this dress is perfect for my florida lifestyle because of the fabric and the design . it is not the color pictured on the web page which was a disappointment . the color is a lot duller . i tried it on in the store and found it to be tight across the chest another lady who also tried it had the same problem . i went home and ordered a larger size . that dress was baggy and not as cute in the back . i realized because of the under slip it could be left open to the waist and work just fine . i ended up"

__label__0 "this wears nicely and is true to photo . flattering in the waist and on a petite everything fell in the right places . i also like the lightweight creppy skirt fabric . just one design note - the tie is sort of strange . essentially there 's a long tube of fabric coming out of each side of the bust - and it looks very odd when the ties are undone ."
__label__-1 "like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy . it must be pinned in the picture online . it 's very frustrating when they do that . thank goodness i did n't pay for shipping ! for reference i 'm 5 ' 2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs it 's going back for sure . i 'm trying to lose baby weight not trying to look pregnant !"
__label__-1 "they look nice on the page but they did n't work on my body . made me look big and boxy . maybe if you 're super-skinny they 'll be fine ."

__label__-1 "super cute dress online on the model . what you ca n't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight . it might be my body type . otherwise it 's super cute in person and i wish it would 've fit better !"

__label__0 "purchased this sweater as a gift for my daughter and when i saw it wanted one for myself . it is a light to medium weight and works well with jeans or for work . the sweater is shaped smaller at bottom and is flattering . the one problem was that when you raise your arms the sweater also rises to expose your torso . it was returned ."
__label__-1 "this skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i 've ever ordered from retailer . it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving . it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all . there are also weird stitching lines . one more thing that i did n't like about the skirt was that it 's a cream-ish color . not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt . it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "i ordered these a size up because i 'd just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size . my pre-pre baby size ( chubby phase ) were size 8/29 . these fit like a size 4. way too small . very disappointed !"
