-1,Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me  thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.,Blouses
-1,I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn't wait to wear it. after one day of wear  i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed.,Blouses
-1,Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin,Blouses
-1,So  i want to start off by saying  the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern  unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom  it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have,Blouses
-1,I wanted to love this  was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful  but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top  and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back  in the back  because it does not lay flat like that in front  it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.,Blouses
-1,I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail  and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey  but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer  so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms  small on body. odd fit.,Blouses
-1,This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,Blouses
-1,Loved this shirt when i saw the picture. unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it. you can't really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all (i am only 34b...so would say of average size bust) this shirt will not fit well. there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering/doesn't fit well . the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i'd have thought from the photo.  really wanted to love this - but unless you have a smaller chest it lik,Blouses
-1,If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade,Blouses
0,I had reservations about this top based on other reviews  but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances. i have an athletic build--not model-thin  but not dumpy either--and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly. the sleeves were especially unflattering. i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs.,Blouses
0,Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.,Blouses
0,I so badly wanted this top to work. it looks so cute! but  as soon as i tried it on  i knew it wasn't a keeper. i didn't even need a mirror! it's not suited for those of us with a bust (i'm a 34d) and anything but a lanky model-esque frame. i suggest sizing up if you're busty and want to give it a try. it looked dowdy on me.,Blouses
0,I'd been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews. when it went on sale i thought i'd try but it was like a tent on me. the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo. too bad because the color was gorgeous & could have been a favorite of looked like photo.,Blouses
0,I love this shirt. tried in on in stores. i'm typically a medium across the board. i'm 5'6  137lbs  34d. i went for the size 6 figuring the 4 would be too small. the 6 fit... but it's short like everyone else said. not crop top short but definitely raise your arms and stomach is exposed short. i didn't buy it for the $50 price tag because of the shortness. but now that it's 30% i might spring for it  regardless of the weird cut. it's super cute otherwise!,Blouses
0,Purchased this top because of the sale. i got it in the peach and the maize. i think it is big  boxy  and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have. the colors are vibrant and striking. pretty with shorts and capris. i did size down from 2 to 0,Blouses
0,Fell in love with the look of this top in the store but they didn't have it in my size (0) -- thought i'd try the 2 as the 0 was sold out online as well. alas  the fit is rather tentlike -- it did not drape as i had hoped. a beautiful and unique pattern on the right body  but on my slight frame it was not flattering. it's going back to retailer.,Blouses
0,Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole  but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back  even with the sale price.,Blouses
0,This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester  i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath  which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.,Blouses
1,I tried on a small  but usually am xs:    this shirt dind't seem like it had too much fabric or too bulky to me as it did to others adn i tried on a larger size. teh material is soft and feminine  and love the embroidered detail. one thing to note is i found that even with the layer of fabric  it was still a bit sheer and i could see through in some of the dressing room lighting. didn't purchase only based on the skin tone v's shirt color. color of shirt is gorgeous  but i am pale and it wasn't,Blouses
1,"I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store. i am petite and only 5'2""  so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute. there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on  but i think it is still super cute and flattering. i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type. i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs",Blouses
1,I am in love with this top. flannel shirts are a fall staple  but i don't own any. any flannel shirt that i have come across has been a button down  which simply does not work for me  given my chest size. i hate button downs that gap or that i have to leave unbuttoned and wear a tank underneath. it's not flattering. this top is flannel  no buttons  and off the shoulder  which is such a unique and fresh style. the off the shoulder feature stays in place thanks to tiny straps sewn in that you put,Blouses
1,I love this tunic the natural color is just that  this is a tunic so the fit is a little large. i kept it and had it altered because i really do love this top,Blouses
1,This top is very pretty and figure-flattering because of the way it nips in under the bust. the neckline and color are also flattering. however  it runs a bit small and you need to get the right fit for the bust  balancing the band under the bustline with the roominess of the chest area. there is a side zipper but it can still be a little tricky to get on and off. i wound up not buying it due to the price  but i'd probably snap it on sale.,Blouses
1,I bought this is the orange/red motif and it is a beautiful print  although in person it is a more rich reddish color than the washed out model image. the entire shirt is sheer  so i will need to wear something under  but that doesn't bother me. i have a small chest (34a) and find that the front of the shirt is noticeably longer than the back  but that wouldn't be an issue if i was a little better endowed. this looks gorgeous with black pants and a blazer. not sure that it is worth full price  b,Blouses
1,I saw this in the store and wanted to try it but couldn't justify buying *another* denim shirt at this price. then it went on sale! as others said  this does run a bit small though the chest/shoulders  so i sized up one size. it's still slightly fitted  but my broad shoulders are used to that. i was afraid that the pleats would give a maternity look (although my chest size is not that large 36b)-- it doesn't do that on me. it's loose but not overly so--kinda like the current swing top trend! the,Blouses
1,I bought this at the store today and it's the perfect summer top! i'm not going to pull it off my shoulders  so it's a little shorter than shown here. but it goes great with capris and skinny jeans and i plan to take it with me to italy. it will go with so many things! very well made  thickish material.,Blouses
1,Super cute  great for a casual summer day. fabric is nice and light and honey color goes well with denim  kaki  or olive green. runs a little large but still looks good especially with fitted jeans or capri pants.,Blouses
-1,"So i really loved this dress. i am tall (6ft) and the size 8 was perfect length. i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals. i would say it is true to size. i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of ""flow"" without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack. the back is just gorgeous and unique. here is why i couldn't make it mine. the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin. there is literally not much to it and i'm not sure it wou",Dresses
-1,No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.,Dresses
-1,I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.,Dresses
-1,This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.,Dresses
-1,I wanted to like this but it just didn't have much of a shape  not flattering at all. maybe if i was taller?,Dresses
-1,Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference  i'm 5'4  129lbs  36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty  vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.,Dresses
-1,"I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it  but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider  more well-defined waist  with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top  but this was not the case. yes  the waist fit  but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top  turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly  this is going right back!",Dresses
-1,Quality was not what you expect from retailer  especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat  it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.,Dresses
-1,"This dress looks lovely on the model  but it looks just awful on me! i am 5'4"" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve  it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space. the material is nice and the sequins are pretty  but the cut of the dress is unflattering.",Dresses
0,"I just received this dress in the mail today. i ordered an xs and it was huge! there is no way that i could wear a bra without it showing due to the size of the arm holes. i'm 5'2"" and 117 lbs with an athletic build for reference. i love free flowing dresses  but this was over the top. i ordered the plaid version in an xs petite and that fit much truer to size. i reordered this in an xs petite to see if that will work better. the dress itself is lovely. the green color is vibrant and the embroid",Dresses
0,Yes  i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away. it's not mean for everybody. it would look good on a stick figure. if you have some hips  they balloon out.,Dresses
0,I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge  i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design.,Dresses
0,I wanted so badly for this dress to work on me. the design is amazing. the detail is so pretty and delicate. its my version of the perfect little black dress! however i have very big arms...and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress  the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all. i'm usually a 14-16 in dresses. i tried the 16 and it just didn't work. the arms were way too tight. however i've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me  and they,Dresses
0,Ordered it because i am fan of floral dresses. i found that colors are not as bright as pictured  overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight  not too heavy nor too light  it is not itchy  but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right  i got my usual m and i am 5'10'' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper  but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short  i had to pull them up t,Dresses
0,The snake and the studs  they make the dress. sadly  the snake is hard to find  as mentioned in another review. this dress also runs large  i'm usually a 12 and went down to 10. the images are misleading too. two pics show a small  fitted look  and the other two show a full  swing look. i'm trying to make this work but it may have to go.,Dresses
0,This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress  but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small)  and i am larger on top  so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front  but it was just the back.,Dresses
0,I so badly wanted this dress to work for me. the material and color is so beautiful. this had a 'sack like' fit and the side pockets accentuated my hips giving me a broader look than i would like.,Dresses
0,I didn't have as much of a problem with the sheer fabric as the other reviewers  but this dress is incredibly long and large  especially compared to the picture. for reference  i'm usually a 4/6 in retailer dresses and the small was huge on me  particularly on the bottom half. i was very disappointed because this dress looks so cute online!,Dresses
1,This dress is a fun idea- but the one i received had misaligned pleating so a few of the rows of sequins were tucked into the pleat- it threw the lines of the dress off. i ended up returning it but i think it can be amazing if you get one that looks like th stock photo.,Dresses
1,"I tried this dress on in the store and loved it. it's unfortunately out my price range but if i could have afforded it  i would have bought it. i'm about 5'10"" and the length of the size 2 was perfect. sexy back and great color.",Dresses
1,I have had this dress in the shopping basket on my retailer app and was dying to try it on in the store. luckily  newbury street in boston had it so i stopped by yesterday. the dress is everything i hoped and even better! the cut could not be more flattering. to get the nice  classic fit in the front  i stayed true to my usual size (4) but worried the buttons would be straining like another reviewer said. as soon as the bow in the front is tied  it keeps everything together and is very comf,Dresses
1,Has anyone tried to hand wash this dress instead of dryclean?  runs a little large. i am 5'5 135# 34dd and purchased xs. i was really surprised that xs fits well. i initially tried small but the armholes were too big. the waist is a little too high but i plan to wear it with a belt.,Dresses
1,Love this dress. purchased in white. runs true to size. made well.,Dresses
1,I saw this online and loved it  then when it was on sale i went into the store and tried it on and i couldn't resist. the only size that was left in stores was an xs petit and i didn't think that it would fit me because i am usually a regular s/m but it was super comfortable and very stylish. it wasn't too big or too small  it fit me just right without any awkwardness.,Dresses
1,The essence of femininity. simply beautiful. if you begin with the pattern of the dress  you become drawn to it. then  as you look closer and see the slip with its creamy detailed embroidery  and immediately you see how the dress opens at the bodice with tiny  set buttons  you soon realize  that's not all... the bottom of this fine piece of art continues with soft  delicate  chiffon trim with a bonus layer of the most beautiful lace to finish it off. i bought it on sight and just love it. i was,Dresses
1,This dress is gourgeous  will be able to wear year round. just add a cardigan or blazer. the only fault i find in it is the waist band is a bit wide. however i have a hour glass shape  so my waist is very small,Dresses
1,I ordered this in a size s  my usual size and it fits great. i love the color  style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of  ever so slightly  poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color  i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!,Dresses
-1,I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side  so the garment flows nicely  it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial  heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey  not whi,Fine gauge

-1,Got this in purple and love it! ordered red and silver and only received red so far  but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn't fit well like the purple. not sure what happens. maybe miss sized?,Fine gauge
-1,On me  this top is totally frumpy and boxy. i am 5'9  34dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt. not fitted at all. i ordered a large--not being sure of fit. i have a flat stomach and it just hung....yuck. honestly  for the price and fit  i wouldn't consider a medium. i think it would a tad better but not worth the price.,Fine gauge
0,I was so excited to receive this sweater in the mail since my local store didn't carry it. it is a very cute design if you have a smaller frame but i'm curly up top and it didn't lay they way it did on the model. there's plenty of stretch. unfortunately the fabric sheds and itches terribly. you could wear a shirt underneath but i'd have to wear a turtleneck so it'll be going back.,Fine gauge
0,I have a mixed feeling about this cardigan.  on one hand  i like it; on the other hand  there are some minor things i do not like.  first  i love its knit pattern; especially the pattern on the back.  second  i like a soft color of this cardigan.  on website pictures  two motifs look almost the same.  in reality  brown motif is light pink-ish while blue motif is light blue-green-ish.  third  texture.  this cardigan is made of linen and cotton  so it feels comfortable to wear.  if there are flaws,Fine gauge
0,This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color  but it's more dark gray and brown. it wasn't that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up  but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color.,Fine gauge
0,This is really cute but does run large  if your in between sizes size down. the fabric at the front is super bulky but with a smaller size could be ok? it is so itchy  imo uncomfotably so! i would have returned for a smaller size had it not been so uncomfortable  ugh why! i loved the sleeves  very cute bell. and the back hung nicely. they need to make this in a cotton  vocoder and no wool! loved bit couldnt bear it.,Fine gauge
0,The smallest size  xs  was big on me  i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape  doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though  but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green  made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.    for reference xs bog on 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.,Fine gauge
0,First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.,Fine gauge

0,This is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight. however  it is an awkward length. i am tall and have a long torso so it's just not cut right for me and was not flattering.,Fine gauge
0,Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere  it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said  you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.,Fine gauge

1,This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats  etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.,Fine gauge

1,This cardigan caught my eye and i had no idea how soft and wonderful it would feel so it's a win-win! it hangs a little boxy so i'll need to figure out how to style it so it's more flattering. the pockets are a pretty gold color (you can see it from the inside) and adds a nice touch of color. it's a keeper!,Fine gauge
1,I thought this sweater was pretty and soft and would be comfortable to wear. i really liked the high collar and the interesting poncho-like design. but the sleeves were a bit short on me. and i thought it was a little pricy. i decided against it for those reasons. but if you don't mind those things  then you might like it. it's definitely worth the try.,Fine gauge
1,I ordered this because it looked to be a good fit for my casual lifestyle. and it doesn't disappoint! it's cozy  lightweight but warm  flows well and looks great tied or worn loose. i ordered my regular size large in the grey. it fits as shown  just a bit longer because i'm short. the color is more of a blue gray with white striations that are well placed. it's really striking for such a casual piece. very pretty. highly recommend.,Fine gauge

-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates

0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates

0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.,Intimates
0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,Intimates
1,This bra is the one. i have been searching high and low to replace my worn out comfy bra  and this is it. if you are looking for a wireless bra with thin straps that can peek out from your shirt and not announce themselves as hello bra straps  a v-neck cut (none of that scoop cut nonsense)  and you don't care about trying to boost your cleavage  this bra has it all. so comfy too.,Intimates
1,I ordered this bra in my normal size 32d  and it fits me perfectly. this bra is beautiful. the material seems to be very high quality  and the comfort of this bra is amazing. it's definitely a keeper.,Intimates
1,These are soft and skim the body the way well fitted undergarments should. they do not pinch  bind  or ride up. they coordinate perfectly with the matching bra. i am very pleased with this purchase.,Intimates

1,It is an expensive panty  but so worth the money! it is so unique and flattering!,Intimates
1,This bra is obviously very pretty and feminine  but i was surprised that it's also really comfortable! it provides a pretty good amount of support  especially for an unlined bra  and feels pretty sturdy despite there not being much there. my 34b fit true to size.,Intimates
1,"I ordered size small. i am 5' 6""  32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining  and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty  but not much else.",Intimates

-1,"Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the ""captain kangaroo"" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.",Jackets
-1,This looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it  but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.,Jackets
-1,"When i saw this jacket in store  i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3"" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc",Jackets

0,This design looks really sharp on the image  but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft  with a gray jersey lining  it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.      i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b  i felt like i was busting out of a size 8  and i am a 34d.,Jackets
0,I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo  i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs  and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.,Jackets
0,I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter  thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing  more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.,Jackets

0,I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p  as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015  and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p  it was much too,Jackets
0,The blazer is boxy and less dressy that it seemed online. i could only really wear this in casual situations  and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work as well. it does have an interesting hemline. the shoulders are a bit too narrow for me (but i do have shoulders on the broader side). i don't hate it  but i don't love it either  but it is interesting enough that i'm going to keep it. i ordered a small.,Jackets

1,I was looking for a new spring/summer tee that still gave coverage for chillier mornings and nights and this is it. it has a nice swing to it that isn't too wide (think a flattering a-line cut that has some movement towards the bottom hem.) it is fitted and flattering where it needs to be (the shoulders and ribcage run fitted and tts which means you don't get lost in the top. it's not boxy or oversized  but if you want a fitted and more flattering look  you can definitely size down easily  parti,Knits
1,Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.,Knits
1,I bought this top in every color. the fit is so flattering and just flows so nicely - not too big. love!,Knits
1,I absolutely adore this shirt!!! the pinkish rosey color is beautiful and ended up being better than i had imagined. i will say that the shirt is a bit more casual than i thought it was going to be  the way it hangs or something..not really sure. nonetheless  it is perfect. can be dressed up or down  which is the best quality to have in any piece of clothing! i can tell i'm going to get a lot of wear out of it.,Knits
-1,The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.,Layering

-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering

1,The size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra won't show (and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight). it's a bit pricey for a basic  thin tank  but it's a good every day  wear all the time staple.,Layering

1,I received this jacket in an 8. fits great with room . i am a 34dd chest for reference as i was not sure if i needed a 10  but the 8 is perfect. see my pictures as i feel the website photos are more bright as the actual jacket is more muted. buttons are very nice but the pocket flaps hit right at the boob area so it my bother some . very high quality  lined and will look great over some retailer dresses in the same color way i purchased last year. depending on the season this jacket would do fine,Outerwear

1,"I love this coat but it does not work for my body type. it is a beautiful coat and of very good quality. it has a wonderful lining which is so nice to see as many of the ""coats"" retailer is carrying right now are not lined. the coat is soft and feels so good. it seems to run true to size. i would have purchased this if the button placement were higher up. the button closure is right at my hips ( i am 5'6"" for reference) and i am pretty curvy. when open  the coat looked great but when i trie",Outerwear
1,As a long standing retailer shopper  i have seen the beginnings of retailer great quality and detail and somewhat over the years disappointed of quality going down; this vest is so my style and executed very well as being fully lined and sewn well  hooks to close are substantial; the fact the faux fur collar can be removed is a real plus  but though the colors are delish  the fabric is a bit questionable.  the one i ordered on line and sent to me is fresh and not petted  but looking at the same vest,Outerwear

1,I really love this coat! it is beautiful and very comfortable. while the attached scarf does cover the cute buttons  i'm glad it is there! it comes in handy when the temperature drops quicker than anticipated. the only thing missing on this coat is a lining as soft as the exterior.,Outerwear
1,I am keeping this because i got a great deal (30% off sale price)  it fits great (i alternate between xs and s  went with s)  and overall it has nice quality (thick fabric  secure toggles  etc.)  but--what is with the lack of lining? i would hesitate to buy anything from this brand at full price because of that. there are just large seams on the inside  which is tolerable because of the type of fabric  but come on.,Outerwear

-1,I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something  they do not hang or move well on the body. also  they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly  these are going back.,Pants
-1,Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.,Pants

-1,This romper is cute  well-made and true to size  but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.,Pants
-1,Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store  however ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment ,Pants

-1,I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight  sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big  so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first  but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2  4  6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details  but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's,Pants

1,I'm so glad i tried these on at one of my local retailer stores. i didn't really think much of it online but they have a much nicer look and cut in person. i got the navy blue in size 27 which fit tts. i got a regular size vs. the petite size which i usually like to go with because i'm short but i actually found that they fell very similar to the model's length shown online. they seem so versatile  i'm looking forward to wearing these!,Pants

-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.,Shorts

0,The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.,Shorts
0,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,Shorts
0,There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.,Shorts
0,These looked so cute and colorful! very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today. cute overall  but run large. depending on cut/style  i range from 2-4 in bottoms. i ordered a 2 in these  and they were just way too big. i would exchange for a zero  but i bought them for a trip this weekend. oh well.... consequence of online shopping!,Shorts
0,I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy  untreatable stains). unfortunately  the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back,Shorts

0,I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however  the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top  and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price  i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.,Swim

0,First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,Trend

1,I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small  but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine  yes  it is a little hard to zip up  but once on  it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling,Trend
